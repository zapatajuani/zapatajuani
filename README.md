Hi, I'm Juan Ignacio, a software developer from Argentina. Born in '96, I grew up with three older brothers who introduced me to the best of the '90s—Mario, The Simpsons, and DragonBall:dragon:—shaping my passion for technology and games early on.

I’ve always been surrounded by family, friends, and football:soccer:, but my brothers sparked my interest in tech by sitting me down in front of a PC or NES, which ignited my love for learning and exploring the digital world.

Today, I’m a software developer with a background as an electronic technician and a few enriching years of studying astronomical sciences. I'm constantly growing, learning, and embracing new challenges in the tech world.
